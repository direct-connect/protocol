=== Manage web space
The file generated (if done) shall be uploaded the web space of the ADC project. This file should be put in the /versions subdirectory.

The file versions/index.html should be updated to include the new version.

If a file is located at another place at the web space and is (sym or hard) linked to the previous version, then the link should be updated to point to the new version.

The "news" section should be updated to include the new version. The information about the version should be the content provided in the version history section in the document.

Any other link to the previous version should be updated to point to the new version.

The forum shall be updated to manage the new version. All threads related to the new version are typically at the subform Protocols/Advanced Direct Connection/Protocol ideas.

Each thread that has a note in the form of [Future DOCUMENT X.Y.Z] shall be changed to [DOCUMENT X.Y.Z].

All threads marked [DOCUMENT X.Y.Z] shall be moved to the sub-forum Protocols/Advanced Direct Connection/Pushed ideas. This will clear the current discussions list from content that are already approved and released.

The new version shall be announced (in a non-invasive manner) on Twitter and other resources where developers frequent.
